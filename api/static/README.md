# Documentation update - TailWind CSS for default styling

TailWind Css provides more concise styling and customisation for the project. It's documentation can be compared to that of bootstraps. Making it easy to setup and use.

It provides more customization in the form of plugins which make this Framework perfect since I will be using different themes for different pages and those plugin provide themes built for specific themes.

Here are some of the plugins i will be using: -

## 1. Daisy UI

Daisy UI provide the best customization for phones also it's dark theme uses purple as it primary color and this aligns with the projects theme.

### **P.S.**

The defaults where already what I needed so I didn't need to style any heavy customization.
